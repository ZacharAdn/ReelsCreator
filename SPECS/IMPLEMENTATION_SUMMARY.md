# ✅ Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Restructuring Complete!**

The algorithm has been successfully restructured into a modular, stage-based architecture following the plan in `RESTRUCTURING_PLAN.md`.

## 📋 **Current Status Update (2025-08-21)**

### New Issues Identified
1. **Project Organization**
   - Scattered files and duplicated code
   - Unnecessary cache and temporary files
   - Unorganized documentation
   - See detailed plan in [CLEANUP_AND_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md](CLEANUP_AND_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md#-task-1-project-cleanup-and-reorganization)

2. **Segment Quality**
   - Uniform segment scores (all 0.75)
   - Fixed segment lengths (45s)
   - No quality variation detection
   - See detailed plan in [CLEANUP_AND_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md](CLEANUP_AND_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md#-task-2-fix-segment-uniformity-issue)

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Quality profile hangs during processing
   - No progress feedback
   - Memory management issues
   - See detailed plan in [CLEANUP_AND_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md](CLEANUP_AND_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md#-task-3-quality-profile-performance-issues)

### Implementation Status

#### ✅ **Fully Implemented**
- **Stage 1: Audio Extraction** - Complete with VideoProcessor integration
- **Stage 2: Speaker Segmentation** - Complete with hybrid detector
- **Base Infrastructure** - Modular architecture, configuration system
- **Performance Monitoring** - Stage-by-stage timing and bottlenecks

#### 🔄 **In Progress**
- **Quality Profile Optimization** - Performance improvements needed

- **Project Cleanup** - Directory restructuring planned

#### ⏳ **Pending**
- **Documentation Updates** - Need to reflect current state
- **Test Coverage** - Additional test cases needed
- **Performance Tuning** - Further optimizations required

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

See [CLEANUP_AND_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md](CLEANUP_AND_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md) for detailed implementation plans for:
1. Project cleanup and reorganization
2. Fixing segment uniformity issues
3. Resolving quality profile performance problems
